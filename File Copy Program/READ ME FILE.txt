flame_cp- A simple File copy C Program

GROUP: Varsha Gunturu, Abhipsha Luitel

Description:

flame_cp is a simple c program that utilises the command line for copying files. The program can read a specific	input file through the file's path and copy it into another file through the copy file's path.

We are Mac users and hence based on how it runs on the Mac, we have detailed the steps.

Open the terminal at Assignment 1 folder. 
Run the command  " gcc my_copy.c -o flame_cp "
Then run the command " ./flame_cp -i main_file.c -o copy_file_destination.c "


COMMAND LINE/ TERMINAL:

gcc my_copy.c -o flame_cp

./flame_cp -i <source file path name> -o <destination file pathname>

This copies the contents of file main_file.c to copy_file_destination.c.
