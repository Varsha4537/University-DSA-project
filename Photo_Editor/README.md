3. Make sure that when you are trying to choose an option, plase move the mouse to the image window and press the necessary keyword. The terminal will display whether it was successful or not. Which can also been seen in the image window.
4. To input the values, font, etc please return to the terinal to input the values. For example for temperature, the input value will be taken from the terminal.
